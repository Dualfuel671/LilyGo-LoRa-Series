// Archived legacy Beacon implementation (combined LoRa pseudo-AX.25 and FSK modes)
// Moved from src/Beacon.cpp on archival to keep build lean. Not compiled by default.
// To resurrect, copy back into src/ and adjust platformio.ini environments.

#include "../src/Beacon.cpp" // Intentional reference for quick resurrection; remove if copying manually.
